## Projects
### Pet Hotel
This is a game created for my midterm in Programming 101. The objective of this game is to take care of pets and satisfy their needs to increase their happiness. The task of this project was to demonstrate the C# skills we learned in class.

*Created several arrays of strings for names, animal types, and activities. CreateRandomPet() generates a new, randomized pet each day.*

*StartDay() creates a new day with a new pet. Activities() uses a for loop to list the various activities. Also implemented are switch cases to differentiate each activity.*

*Using integers for the formula. Created two methods/functions to execute the recursion feature.*

*Shows strings of various words to implement in the program. Prints out what type of word is needed for each entry.*

### Tip Calculator
A simple porgram created in class that calculates a tip.

*Shows use of classes and methods to find the total cost (bill total).*

*Asks user how much they want to tip. Choices are shown in switch statements, with each case being a certain percentage.*

### Substitution Cipher
This program demonstrates how to use arrays and characters to encode and decode messages.

*Uses alphabet and random letter arrays. Uses user input and the .ToUpper() function.*

*Shows the code for how the Encode and Decode functions work. Uses char[] for the alphabet and substitute letters, as well as their arrays. Also uses for loops to iterate through arrays.*
